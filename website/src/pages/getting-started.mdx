# Getting Started

React Calendar Kit is a powerful and flexible library for building accessible and highly customizable calendar and date/time picker components in your React applications. Built on top of the robust accessibility features of the [@react-aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html) library, React Calendar Kit provides a solid foundation for creating inclusive user experiences.

<Steps>
### Install

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm i react-calendar-kit
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm i react-calendar-kit
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn add react-calendar-kit
    ```
  </Tab>
    <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun add react-calendar-kit
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Add Calendar to your app

It can be placed anywhere, even in server components such as `layout.tsx`.

```tsx
export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

</Steps>
